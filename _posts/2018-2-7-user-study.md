## User Study

In order to find the best performing Speech to Text API, I compared the available API's. This turned out to be Google Speech API and Microsoft Bing API. IBM Watson was also available but a prototype has already been trialed and was not found to return good enough results. 

The study comprised of a set of 10 past questions from Stack Overflow, these questions were provided to participants and they dictated them through an online voice recording web app, there were a few issues with this app mainly due to some compatibility issues on iOS devices. None the less I still managed to get good range of participants with a variety of different nationalities / accents. 

I had previously created a prototype which allowed me to send these voice recordings to both API's from Google and Microsoft for transcription, these results were then compared with the expected results and scored based on the error rate. In the end Google Speech API performed significantly better overall.
