I am a Software Engineering Student at the university of Strathclyde, I am in my final year of my Honours degree. Therfore over the next few months I will use this blog to keep track of the progress of my final project. I will also use this blog to list any challenges or problems I encounter along the way. Hopefully I will also be able to detail how I overcame these problems!
