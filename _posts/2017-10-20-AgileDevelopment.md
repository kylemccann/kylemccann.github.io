## Trello & Agile Development

During the development of my project I will try and follow the Agile Development principles. I am going to make use of Trello which allows you to use story boards and have a project backlog. Currently I have a 'swimlane' for Backlog, In progress and Completed however this could be changed to included a section for staged and approved tasks. As It may be that a change needs some re-working.

Trello works similarly to other issue trackers and task tools. It allows you to create a card for each task that needs to be done. It has quite a simplistic UI and non-cluttered UI and from first impressions looks to be a good prodcut.
